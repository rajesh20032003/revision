/**
 * Resolves the ignore files that apply to a directory: its own and every one
 * above it, up to the workspace root.
 *
 * Ignore files cascade - a `.gitignore` covers its own directory and below, and
 * its patterns are relative to *itself*, not to the workspace root. Reading only
 * the root file, which is what `getIgnoreObject` does, silently misses every
 * nested one.
 *
 * A directory's answer is its own files plus its parent's, so every directory on
 * the way up is memoized rather than only the one asked for: sibling leaves
 * share the whole trunk, and a later walk stops at the first directory already
 * known.
 *
 * `read` decides where the files come from - `tree.read` for a generator, disk
 * for a caller with no tree - and returns an empty string or null when there is
 * no such file. Paths handed to it are workspace-relative POSIX.
 *
 * `merge` decides how the files *within one directory* relate, and the two
 * consumers genuinely need different rules:
 *
 * - `false` is prettier's: one matcher per file, any of them excluding wins, and
 *   a negation counts only if none excluded. `createIsIgnoredFunction` builds an
 *   ignorer per `--ignore-path` and ORs them, so a `!x` in `.prettierignore`
 *   cannot re-include an `x` that `.gitignore` excluded.
 * - `true` is git's and the native walker's: all files in one matcher, so
 *   `.nxignore`'s `!x` removes `.gitignore`'s exclusion of `x` outright. It has
 *   to be a merge rather than a precedence check between separate matchers,
 *   because a lone `!x` in its own matcher reports an opinion on `x/` but *none*
 *   on `x/a.ts` (measured), so the exclusion would still reach the children.
 *   The merge only removes the exclusion within that one directory - a negation
 *   in a nested file still loses to an ancestor's exclusion.
 *
 * When `merge` is true, `filenames` order matters: they go into one matcher in
 * order and the last matching pattern decides, so list them lowest-authority
 * first.

 * True when the file is ignored, resolving the chain nearest file first.
 *
 * Each matcher is tested against the path relative to its own directory, which
 * is what makes a nested pattern like `/build` mean that directory's `build`
 * rather than the workspace's.
 *
 * Nearest directory with an *opinion* wins, not the first match: a nested
 * `!keep.log` must override the root's `*.log`, which is git's rule for files.
 * A nested negation of a *directory* does not reach its children - see the
 * `merge` note on `createIgnoreChainResolver`.
 *
 * How the files of one directory relate is decided when the chain is built - see
 * that same note. Here they are simply the entry's matchers: any one excluding
 * wins, and a negation counts only if none excluded.
 *
 * Two preconditions, both satisfied by a pruning walk and neither enforced:
 *
 * - `filePath` is workspace-relative POSIX and must sit under every `dir` in the
 *   chain, which holds when the chain came from that file's own directory.
 * - No ancestor directory of `filePath` may itself be ignored. git refuses to
 *   re-include a file inside an excluded directory, and this does not implement
 *   that rule: asked directly about `dist/keep.ts` with a root `dist/` and a
 *   nested `dist/.gitignore` holding `!keep.ts`, it answers "not ignored" where
 *   git says ignored (measured). `visitNotIgnoredFiles` never asks, because it
 *   prunes `dist/` before descending - which is what makes its answers match
 *   git, and why that pruning is load-bearing for correctness rather than speed.
